# Discord_Bot

## Inspiration (Problem Solved)
Many individuals and organizations began working remotely, sheltering in place and changing their behaviors to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As daily routines changed overnight, more of people's daily and work lives shifted online, and social media became an even more important tool for connection. As college students, we constantly face struggles to connect with our peers and this lack of connection leads to hindrances in overall personality development. 
 
## What it does
FOMO provides the user with a personalized list of events based on their selected interests.
1. the user enters their interests --> USER DATA CREATED
2. Information from different announcements about events is collected. --->EVENTS DATA CREATED
3. bot checks all the events and categorizes them into possible tags 
4. The AI provides tags to the person's interests on basis of the questionnaire
5. The bot matches the tags and using neural networks creates a comprehensive  list of events sorted on the basis of users  and sends to the user on personal messages the events are sorted based on the user's interests 


## How we built it (Tech Used)
We used :
1. Discord bots (understanding how a discord bot works and also how to make one, we also made two bots argue with each other XD. )
2. neural networks
3. TensorFlow
4. python  


## Challenges we ran into
- sleep deprivation
-lack of data
-learning everything from scratch

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-Managing learning neural networks
-Managing completing a complex AI project, even though majorly being a team of novice coders. 

## What we learned
- basics of neural networking
- brief understanding of discord bots and their working.
- understanding the basic requirements for making a user-interactive chat box 

## What's next for FOMO - FearNot Of Missing Out! (Future Prospects)
1. Adding in social groups​
2. Integrating with the calendar​
3. Take into account your To-Do list for the day
4. RSVP for the event​
5. Adding ReCaptcha to increase security and reliability on events.
